        <h3 class="explore-heading2">Turkey</h3>
        <p class="explore-text"> Turkey ranks among the top travel destinations in the world, thanks to such attractions as stylish Istanbul, which has one of the globe's youngest populations,
                the chic beach towns along the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, the wealth of world-class historic sites and ruins, and the unforgettable landscapes of desert spots like Cappadocia.
                Add to that the incredible cuisine, the famous bazaars and artisan trades, and the decadent hammam spa traditions, and it's clear that Turkey travel offers something for everyone.
                The regions bordering the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas are cool and wet in the winter, with dry and sunny days in the summer. The mountain regions see snow in the winter, making 
                them perfect for winter sports enthusiasts, while Istanbul can be visited all year round. Spring, summer and fall are best to take advantage of Istanbul's outdoor cafes, Bosphorus cruises, and city parks.

        <h3 class="explore-heading2">Japan</h3>
        <p class="explore-text">Located in the Pacific Ocean, Japan consists of four major islands and is roughly the size of California. Every year, millions of tourists from across the world travel
             to Japan to enjoy its culture, shopping, nightlife and scenery.  With a rich history and a mild climate, Japan offers plenty of attractions and activities for visitors of all ages.
             From bustling cities to ancient temples to tranquil gardens, tourists have numerous attractions to choose from during their Japanese vacation. Most tourists make a stop in Tokyo to visit
             its shops, restaurants and museums. According to Japan-Guide.com, the best times to visit Japan are during the months of April, October and November. In April, the weather is mild and 
             the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. In October and November, the climate is warm and the autumn leaves are supposed to be spectacular. Typically, airfare and hotel costs are lower
            during these months.

        <h3 class="explore-heading2">Australia</h3>
        <p class="explore-text">Australia is an incredibly diverse island, continent, and country- both culturally and geographically speaking. The widely recognized “Outback” takes up the center of the giant island, but most other areas contain 
               everything from rainforests, to mountains and canyons, to world-famous beaches. Nearly all of Australia’s population lives within 50 miles of the coastline. As a former [penal colony, the country is now a mixture of modern cosmopolitan
               culture and ancient Aboriginal traditions. The cities of Perth, Melbourne, and Sydney are scenic and thriving melting pots. The country itself deserves many trips of discovery, or at least a two-week hiatus to explore some of its key
               places.A visit to Australia guarantees fantastic sightseeing, nightlife, and adventurous experiences to remember forever.

    <section class="explore-container2">
        <h3 class="explore-heading2">Iceland</h3>
        <p class="explore-text">Iceland exercises the imagination like no other destination. Waterfalls seem to pour over every cliff edge and mountain face, mud pots pop, volcanoes smoke and fume, and a bitter Arctic wind howls across
                the otherworldly lava fields and fjords. Iceland’s built world, too, is a reflection of the island’s wild landscapes. Hipster cafés sell bread baked by geothermal heat, designer boutiques are filled with Scandinavian
                prints and natural fabrics, and public pools spill over with mineral-rich waters. While Iceland looks like it’s floating at the edge of the Earth, it’s actually more accessible than ever. It’s a short nonstop flight 
                from the East Coast of the United States, and European travelers can even reach its rugged shores by ferry. Depending on when you visit, the Land of Fire and Ice might be drenched in a deep-red midnight sun—or lit 
                by the flickering aurora borealis during otherwise dark winter days.

        <h3 class="explore-heading2">Italy</h3>
        <p class="explore-text">Italy’s Mediterranean climate makes it a year-round destination with thrilling activities for every season. In general, the summers are hot and dry, and the winters are cold and damp. In general, the
                best months to visit Italy are April to June and September to October when the weather is comfortably warm. July and August can be stiflingly hot and muggy, and most Italians go on holiday in August, shuttering 
                many shops and restaurants. Where does one begin with Italy? Italy is the land of mouthwatering meals that last all night, heady wines to drink underneath olive trees, pastel villas built into sheer cliffs above 
                the crystal blue Tyrrhenian Sea, and Renaissance paintings and marble sculptures that leave you awestruck and inspired. It is everyone’s dream to travel to Italy, and for good reason.

        <h3 class="explore-heading2">Spain</h3>
        <p class="explore-text">Spain itself is a natural wonder. The Pyrenees and Picos de Europa are as beautiful as any mountain range on the continent, while the snowcapped Sierra Nevada rises up improbably from the sun-baked plains of
                Andalucía. The wildly beautiful cliffs of Spain’s Atlantic northwest are offset by the charming coves of the Mediterranean. Spain is considered an exotic country in Europe due to its friendly inhabitants, relaxed lifestyle, 
                its cuisine, vibrant nightlife, and world-famous folklore and festivities. Among many places worth visiting are Spain's thriving capital Madrid, the vibrant coastal city of Barcelona, the famous "Running of the Bulls" at 
                Pamplona, major Andalusian cities with Islamic architecture, like Seville, Granada and Córdoba, the Way of St. James and the idyllic Balearic and Canary Islands.
